# Enhanced AI with Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning

This guide describes the enhanced AI implementation for the Arya-Gomoku game, featuring minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and transposition table optimization.

## Overview

The enhanced AI provides significantly stronger gameplay compared to the original heuristic-based AI, with multiple difficulty levels and performance optimizations.

## Features

### 1. Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **Minimax**: Recursive search algorithm that explores possible moves to a specified depth
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes minimax by eliminating branches that won't affect the final decision
- **Performance Gain**: Typically reduces search space by 50%+ compared to pure minimax

### 2. Transposition Table
- **Purpose**: Caches evaluated board positions to avoid redundant calculations
- **Implementation**: Uses SHA256 hashing for board state identification
- **Storage**: In-memory cache with thread-safe access
- **Performance**: Significant speedup for repeated position evaluations

### 3. Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Depth 2, simple heuristic moves (< 100ms)
- **Medium**: Depth 4, balanced gameplay (100-500ms)
- **Hard**: Depth 6, deep analysis (500ms-2s)
- **Expert**: Depth 8, maximum depth with time limit (2-5s)

### 4. Smart Move Pruning
- **Search Radius**: Only considers moves within 2 squares of existing pieces
- **Opening Book**: Center-focused moves for empty boards
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced pattern evaluation for strategic positions

## API Usage

### Basic AI Move
```javascript
// Get AI move with default medium difficulty
const response = await aiApi.getMove(request);

// With specific difficulty
const response = await aiApi.getMove(request, 'hard');

// Use original AI instead of enhanced
const response = await aiApi.getMove(request, 'medium', false);
```

## Algorithm Details

### Evaluation Function
The AI uses a sophisticated evaluation function that considers:

1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Five in a row: +100,000 points (win)
   - Open four: +10,000 points
   - Three with open ends: +1,000 points
   - Two with potential: +50-100 points

2. **Positional Bonuses**
   - Center control preference
   - Distance from last move
   - Board edge considerations

3. **Tactical Elements**
   - Threat creation and blocking
   - Double threats detection
   - Forced move recognition

### Search Optimization
1. **Move Ordering**: Moves are ordered by heuristic score to maximize alpha-beta pruning
2. **Iterative Deepening**: Searches incrementally deeper until time limit
3. **Time Management**: 5-second maximum thinking time per move
4. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of transposition table

## Performance Characteristics

### Search Speed
- **Easy**: < 100ms per move
- **Medium**: 100-500ms per move
- **Hard**: 500ms-2s per move
- **Expert**: 2-5s per move (time-limited)

### Pruning Efficiency
- Typically 40-70% of nodes are pruned by alpha-beta
- Transposition table provides additional 20-30% speedup
- Memory usage scales with game complexity

### Strength Analysis
- **Easy**: Suitable for beginners, makes occasional mistakes
- **Medium**: Challenging for average players, good balance
- **Hard**: Strong play, difficult for most humans
- **Expert**: Maximum strength, requires optimal play to win
